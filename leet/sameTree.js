R: 
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

E:
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true

                  1                                        1
            2           3                               2       3



Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false

                1                                           1
            2                                                   2


            
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false

                1                                           1
            2       1                                   1       2
